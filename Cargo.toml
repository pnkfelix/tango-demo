# The `build = ...` line is how we hook in the tango-preprocessor.
# It can be as simple as:
# ```rust
# extern crate tango;
#
# fn main() { tango::process_root().unwrap() }
# ```

build = "tango-build.rs"

# The preprocessor is the `tango` crate, so we need to add that
# to the build-dependencies.

[build-dependencies]
tango = "0.7.*"

# Since the lib may be a tango file stored in `src/lib.md`, we need to
# explicitly specify that this is a library project with a `[lib]`
# section, which then requires an explicit name. More recent versions
# of cargo also require an explicit path to the "src/lib.rs" file,
# because it does not exist in the initial checkout, but will be
# generated by tango.
